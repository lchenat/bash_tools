My bash tools for a more convenient life.

### To
**To** can help you create a list of your favorite directories you frequently visit, and provide fast access to them.

#### Create a new link to you favorite directory
```bash
to -c name path_of_directory
```

If you want to create a link with the name same as the directory's name, use the following command:

```bash
to -c path_of_directory
```
